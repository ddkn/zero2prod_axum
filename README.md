# zero2prod_axum

This is my journey of going through the book [Zero 2 Production 2e](https://www.zero2prod.com/) that uses [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/). My intention is to learn axum due to being created by the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) developers, and forcing myself to look at the docs versus what is verbatim in the book. I may end this prematurely, depending on how comfortable I become with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) development. If I do, I will indicate below.

## Build

```
cargo build

## Run

The command line options may change over time, but the basic usage should match to run on `127.0.0.1:9000`,

```
cargo run -- --port 9000
```
